 * also available. Read the [SDK features guide](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/concepts/data-stores).
 * You will not need to use this interface unless you are writing your own implementation.
 *
 * Feature store methods can and should call their callbacks directly whenever possible, rather
 * than deferring them with setImmediate() or process.nextTick(). This means that if for any
 * reason you are updating or querying a feature store directly in your application code (which
 * is not part of normal use of the SDK) you should be aware that the callback may be executed
 * immediately.
