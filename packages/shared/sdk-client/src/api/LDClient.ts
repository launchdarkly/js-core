   *   and had to give up; to distinguish between these cases, see below.
   * - `"initialized"`: The client successfully started up and has valid feature flag
   *   data. This will always be accompanied by `"ready"`.
   * - `"failed"`: The client encountered an error that prevented it from connecting to
   *   LaunchDarkly, such as an invalid environment ID. All flag evaluations will
   *   therefore receive default values. This will always be accompanied by `"ready"`.
   * - `"error"`: General event for any kind of error condition during client operation.
   *   The callback parameter is an Error object. If you do not listen for "error"
   *   events, then the errors will be logged with `console.log()`.
   * - `"change"`: The client has received new feature flag data. This can happen either
   *   because you have switched contexts with {@link identify}, or because the client has a
   *   stream connection and has received a live change to a flag value (see below).
   *   The callback parameter is an {@link LDFlagChangeset}.
   * - `"change:FLAG-KEY"`: The client has received a new value for a specific flag
   *   whose key is `FLAG-KEY`. The callback receives two parameters: the current (new)
   *   flag value, and the previous value. This is always accompanied by a general
   *   `"change"` event as described above; you can listen for either or both.
   *
   * The `"change"` and `"change:FLAG-KEY"` events have special behavior: by default, the
   * client will open a streaming connection to receive live changes if and only if
   * you are listening for one of these events. This behavior can be overridden by
   * setting `streaming` in {@link LDOptions} or calling {@link LDClient.setStreaming}.
   *
   * @param key
   *   The name of the event for which to listen.
   * @param callback
   *   The function to execute when the event fires. The callback may or may not
