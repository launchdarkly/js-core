/**
 * An asynchronous task queue with the ability to replace pending tasks.
 *
 * This is useful when you have asynchronous operations which much execute in order, and for cases where intermediate
 * operations can be discarded.
 *
 * For instance, the SDK can only have one active context at a time, if you request identification of many contexts,
 * then the ultimate state will be based on the last request. The intermediate identifies can be discarded.
 *
 * This class will always begin execution of the first item added to the queue, at that point the item itself is not
 * queued, but active. If another request is made while that item is still active, then it is added to the queue.
 * A third request would then replace the second request if the second request had not yet become active, and it was
 * sheddable.
 *
 * Once a task is active the queue will complete it. It doesn't cancel tasks that it has started, but it can shed tasks
 * that have not started.
 *
 * TTaskResult Is the return type of the task to be executed. Tasks accept no parameters. So if you need parameters
 * you should use a lambda to capture them.
 *
 * Exceptions from tasks are always handled and the execute method will never reject a promise.
 *
 * Queue management should be done synchronously. There should not be asynchronous operations between checking the queue
 * and acting on the results of said check.
