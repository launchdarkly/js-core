   * The Promise will be resolved if the client successfully initializes, or rejected if client
   * initialization has failed unrecoverably (for instance, if it detects that the SDK key is
   * invalid). Keep in mind that unhandled Promise rejections can be fatal in Node, so if you call
   * this method, be sure to attach a rejection handler to it (or, if using `async`/`await`, a catch
   * block).
   *
   * Note that you can also use event listeners ({@link on}) for the same purpose: the event
   * `"ready"` indicates success, and `"failed"` indicates failure.
   *
   * This method takes an optional parameters which include a timeout. The timeout controls how long
   * a specific call to waitForInitialization will wait before rejecting its promise. If a
   * subsequent call is made to waitForInitialization with a timeout, then it will again wait up to
   * that maximum time.
   *
   * Regardless of whether you continue to wait, the SDK will still retry all connection failures
   * indefinitely unless it gets an unrecoverable error as described above.
   *
   * Waiting indefinitely, or depending only on the "ready" or "failed" events can result in an
   * application waiting indefinitely. It is recommended to use a timeout which is reasonable
   * for your application.

   * fails. If successful, the result is the same client object. It is not recommended to use the
   * returned client object. It will be removed in a future version.
   *
   * @example
   * This example shows use of Promise chaining methods for specifying handlers:
   * ```javascript
   *   client.waitForInitialization({timeoutSeconds: 10}).then(() => {
   *     // do whatever is appropriate if initialization has succeeded
   *   }).catch(err => {
   *     // do whatever is appropriate if initialization has failed or timed out
