/**
 * Wraps around an edge provider to cache a copy of the SDK payload locally.
 *
 * If a cacheTtlMs is specified, then the cacheable store provider will cache
 * results for that specified duration. If the data lookup fails after that
 * interval, previously stored values will be retained. The lookup will be
 * retried again after the TTL.
 *
 * If no cacheTtlMs is specified, the cache will be stored for the lifetime of
 * the object. The cache can be manually refreshed by calling
 * `prefetchPayloadFromOriginStore`.
 *
 * The wrapper is necessary to ensure that we don't make redundant sub-requests
 * from Akamai to fetch an entire environment payload. At the time of this writing,
 * the Akamai documentation (https://techdocs.akamai.com/edgeworkers/docs/resource-tier-limitations)
 * limits the number of sub-requests to:
 *
 * - 2 for basic compute
 * - 4 for dynamic compute
 * - 10 for enterprise
