## Quick Setup

This package provides OpenAI integration for the LaunchDarkly AI SDK. The simplest way to use it is with the LaunchDarkly AI SDK's `initChat` method:

1. Install the required packages:

```shell
npm install @launchdarkly/server-sdk-ai @launchdarkly/server-sdk-ai-openai --save
```

2. Create a chat session and use it:

```typescript
import { init } from '@launchdarkly/node-server-sdk';
import { initAi } from '@launchdarkly/server-sdk-ai';

// Initialize LaunchDarkly client
const ldClient = init(sdkKey);
const aiClient = initAi(ldClient);

// Create a chat session
const defaultConfig = { 
  enabled: true, 
  model: { name: 'gpt-4' },
  provider: { name: 'openai' }
};
const chat = await aiClient.initChat('my-chat-config', context, defaultConfig);

if (chat) {
  const response = await chat.invoke("What is the capital of France?");
  console.log(response.message.content);
}
```

For more information about using the LaunchDarkly AI SDK, see the [LaunchDarkly AI SDK documentation](https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-core/tree/main/packages/sdk/server-ai/README.md).

## Advanced Usage

For more control, you can use the OpenAI provider package directly with LaunchDarkly configurations:

```typescript
import { OpenAIProvider } from '@launchdarkly/server-sdk-ai-openai';
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';

// Create an OpenAI client
const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

// Combine LaunchDarkly AI Config messages with user message
const configMessages = aiConfig.messages || [];
const userMessage = { role: 'user', content: 'What is the capital of France?' };
const allMessages = [...configMessages, userMessage];

// Track the model call with LaunchDarkly tracking
const response = await aiConfig.tracker.trackMetricsOf(
  (result) => OpenAIProvider.createAIMetrics(result),
  () => client.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: allMessages,
    temperature: 0.7,
  })
);

console.log('AI Response:', response.choices[0].message.content);
```

## About LaunchDarkly

- LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard. With LaunchDarkly, you can:
  - Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
  - Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
  - Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
  - Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the 'gold' plan get access to more features than users in the 'silver' plan).
  - Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
- LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for a wide variety of languages and technologies. Check out [our documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk) for a complete list.
