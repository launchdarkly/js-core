## Quick Setup

This assumes that you have already installed the LaunchDarkly Node.js SDK, or a compatible edge
SDK.

1. Install this package with `npm` or `yarn`:

```shell
npm install @launchdarkly/server-sdk-ai --save
```

2. Create an AI SDK instance:

```typescript
// The ldClient instance should be created based on the instructions in the relevant SDK.
const aiClient = initAi(ldClient);
```

3. Evaluate a model configuration:

```typescript
const config = await aiClient.modelConfig(
  aiConfigKey!,
  context,
  { enabled: false },
  { myVariable: 'My User Defined Variable' },
);
```

For an example of how to use the config please refer to the examples folder.

## About LaunchDarkly

- LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard. With LaunchDarkly, you can:
  - Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
  - Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
  - Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
  - Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan).
  - Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
- LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for a wide variety of languages and technologies. Check out [our documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk) for a complete list.
