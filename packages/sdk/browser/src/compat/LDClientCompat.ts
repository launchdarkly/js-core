   * Identifies a context to LaunchDarkly.
   *
   * Unlike the server-side SDKs, the client-side JavaScript SDKs maintain a current context state,
   * which is set at initialization time. You only need to call `identify()` if the context has changed
   * since then.
   *
   * Changing the current context also causes all feature flag values to be reloaded. Until that has
   * finished, calls to {@link variation} will still return flag values for the previous context. You can
   * use a callback or a Promise to determine when the new flag values are available.
   *
   * @param context
   *   The context properties. Must contain at least the `key` property.
   * @param hash
   *   The signed context key if you are using [Secure Mode](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/features/secure-mode#configuring-secure-mode-in-the-javascript-client-side-sdk).
   * @param onDone
   *   A function which will be called as soon as the flag values for the new context are available,
   *   with two parameters: an error value (if any), and an {@link LDFlagSet} containing the new values
   *   (which can also be obtained by calling {@link variation}). If the callback is omitted, you will
   *   receive a Promise instead.
   * @returns
   *   If you provided a callback, then nothing. Otherwise, a Promise which resolve once the flag
   *   values for the new context are available, providing an {@link LDFlagSet} containing the new values
   *   (which can also be obtained by calling {@link variation}).

   * Returns a Promise that tracks the client's initialization state.
   *
   * The Promise will be resolved if the client successfully initializes, or rejected if client
   * initialization has irrevocably failed (for instance, if it detects that the SDK key is invalid).
   *
   * ```

   *
   * It is important that you handle the rejection case; otherwise it will become an unhandled Promise
   * rejection, which is a serious error on some platforms. The Promise is not created unless you
   * request it, so if you never call `waitForInitialization()` then you do not have to worry about
   * unhandled rejections.
   *
   * Note that you can also use event listeners ({@link on}) for the same purpose: the event `"initialized"`
   * indicates success, and `"failed"` indicates failure.
   *
   * @param timeout
   *  The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for initialization before rejecting the promise.
   *  Using a large timeout is not recommended. If you use a large timeout and await it, then
   *  any network delays will cause your application to wait a long time before
   *  continuing execution.
   *
   *  If no timeout is specified, then the returned promise will only be resolved when the client
   *  successfully initializes or initialization fails.
   *
   * @returns
   *   A Promise that will be resolved if the client initializes successfully, or rejected if it
   *   fails or the specified timeout elapses.
