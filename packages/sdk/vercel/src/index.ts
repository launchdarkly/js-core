/**
 * Creates an instance of the Vercel LaunchDarkly client.
 *
 * Applications should instantiate a single instance for the lifetime of the worker.
 * The client will begin attempting to connect to the configured Vercel Edge Config as
 * soon as it is created. To determine when it is ready to use, call {@link LDClient.waitForInitialization}.
 *
 * **Important:** Do **not** try to instantiate `LDClient` with its constructor
 * (`new LDClient()/new LDClientImpl()/new LDClient()`); the SDK does not currently support
 * this.
 *
 * @param sdkKey
 *  The client side SDK key. This is only used to query the edgeConfig above,
 *  not to connect with LaunchDarkly servers.
 * @param edgeConfig
 *  The Vercel Edge Config client configured for LaunchDarkly.
 * @param options
 *  Optional configuration settings. The only supported option is logger.
 * @return
 *  The new {@link LDClient} instance.
