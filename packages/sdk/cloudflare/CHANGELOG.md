You can even combine contexts to create "multi-contexts." For detailed information about this version, please refer to the list below. For information on how to upgrade from the previous version, please read the [migration guide](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/server-side/cloudflare/migration-1-to-2).
* The latest version of this SDK replaces [launchdarkly-cloudflare-edge-sdk](https://github.com/launchdarkly/cloudflare-edge-sdk). Please consider updating your application to use this package instead.
