  /**
   * Provides a simple {@link LDLogger} implementation.
   *
   * This logging implementation uses a simple format that includes only the log level
   * and the message text. Output is written to the standard error stream (`console.error`).
   * You can filter by log level as described in [[BasicLoggerOptions.level]].
   *
   * To use the logger created by this function, put it into {@link LDOptions.logger}. If
   * you do not set {@link LDOptions.logger} to anything, the SDK uses a default logger
   * that is equivalent to `basicLogger({ level: 'info' })`.
   *
   * @param options Configuration for the logger. If no options are specified, the
   *   logger uses `{ level: 'info' }`.
   *
   * @example
   * This example shows how to use `basicLogger` in your SDK options to enable console
   * logging only at `warn` and `error` levels.
   * ```javascript
   *   const ldOptions = {
   *     logger: basicLogger({ level: 'warn' }),
   *   };
   * ```
   *
   * @example
   * This example shows how to use `basicLogger` in your SDK options to cause log
   * output to go to `console.log` instead of `console.error`.
   * ```javascript
   *   const ldOptions = {
   *     logger: ld.basicLogger({ destination: console.log }),
   *   };
   * ```
