## Compatibility

This package is compatible with the `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk` version 3.4.0 and later.

## Setup

### For error metric collection only

```
import { initialize } from "launchdarkly-js-client-sdk";
import { initTelemetry, register } from "@launchdarkly/browser-telemetry";

// Initialize the telemetry as early as possible in your application.
// Errors will be missed if they occur before the telemetry is initialized.
// For metrics only, breadcrumbs and stack traces are not required.
initTelemetry({breadcrumbs: false, stack: false});

// Initialize the LaunchDarkly client.
const client = initialize('sdk-key', context);

// Register the client with the telemetry instance.
register(client);
```

### For error monitoring + metric collection

```
import { initialize } from "launchdarkly-js-client-sdk";
import { initTelemetry, register, inspectors } from "@launchdarkly/browser-telemetry";

// Initialize the telemetry as early as possible in your application.
// Errors will be missed if they occur before the telemetry is initialized.
initTelemetry();

// Initialize the LaunchDarkly client.
const client = initialize('sdk-key', context, {
  // Inspectors allows the telemetry SDK to capture feature flag information.
  inspectors: inspectors(),
});

// Register the client with the telemetry instance.
register(client);
```

## About LaunchDarkly

- LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard. With LaunchDarkly, you can:
  - Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
  - Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
  - Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
  - Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan).
  - Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
- LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for a wide variety of languages and technologies. Check out [our documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk) for a complete list.
