# This workflow handles both automated and manual package publishing:
#
# AUTOMATED PUBLISHING (on push to main):
#   - Triggered automatically when changes are pushed to the main branch
#   - Uses release-please to create releases based on conventional commits
#   - Publishes packages to npm automatically when release PRs are merged
#   - All release-* jobs run in dependency order based on package dependencies
#
# MANUAL PUBLISHING (via workflow_dispatch):
#   - Can be triggered manually from the Actions tab
#   - Allows publishing a specific package to npm or jsr
#   - Supports prerelease and dry-run modes
#   - Runs the manual-publish job which builds, tests, and publishes the selected package
#   - Primarily used for pre-release jobs, or to correct publishing errors during the automated process
#
# The workflow uses conditional logic to ensure only the appropriate jobs run:
#   - release-please job: only runs on push events
#   - release-* jobs: only run on push events when their package has a new release
#   - manual-publish job: only runs on workflow_dispatch events
