/**
 * An interface for querying the status of a Big Segment store.
 *
 * The Big Segment store is the component that receives information about Big Segments, normally
 * from a database populated by the LaunchDarkly Relay Proxy. Big Segments are a specific type of
 * user segments. For more information, read the LaunchDarkly documentation:
 * https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/users/big-segments
 *
 * An implementation of this interface is returned by
 * {@link LDClient.bigSegmentStoreStatusProvider}. Application code never needs to implement this
 * interface.
 *
 * Note that this type inherits from `EventEmitter`, so you can use the standard `on()`, `once()`,
 * and `off()` methods to receive status change events. The standard `EventEmitter` methods are not
 * documented here; see the
 * {@link https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter|Node API documentation}. The
 * type of the status change event is `"change"`, and its value is the same value that would be
 * returned by {@link getStatus}.
