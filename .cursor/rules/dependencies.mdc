# Dependency Management Guidelines

## General Principles
- Dependencies should be avoided unless absolutely necessary
- Consider the following factors when evaluating dependencies:
  - Size: Impact on final bundle size (especially important for browser SDK)
  - Maintenance: Risk of becoming unmaintained or deprecated
  - Security: Potential security vulnerabilities
  - Compatibility: Support across all target platforms
  - Conflicts: Potential conflicts with application dependencies

## Package-Specific Guidelines
- Most important to avoid dependencies in:
  - common package
  - sdk-client package
  - sdk-server package
- Individual SDK packages may have specific platform dependencies
- Edge SDKs must use their provider's edge store and may require specific dependencies

## Dependency Selection Criteria
- Only use dependencies for functionality with:
  - Highly-specified behavior
  - Wide usage
  - Active maintenance
  - Large community support
