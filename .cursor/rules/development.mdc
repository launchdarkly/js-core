# General Development Guidelines

## Project Structure
- This is a monorepo containing multiple JavaScript SDK packages
- Packages are organized into categories:
  - Shared packages (common code)
  - SDK packages (platform-specific implementations)
  - Store packages (persistent storage)
  - Telemetry packages (monitoring)
  - Tooling packages (development tools)

## Build Requirements
- Node environment version 16 required, this is a minimum.
- yarn required
- Some projects may have specific environment prerequisites

## Build Process
- Use `yarn` to install dependencies from project root
- Use `yarn build` to build all projects
- For single project builds:
  ```
  yarn workspaces foreach -pR --topological-dev --from '@launchdarkly/js-client-sdk' run build
  ```
- Replace package name as needed
- Running `yarn build` in individual packages won't rebuild dependencies
